# ROADMAP

## 0.0.x
I will first need to explore different way to achieve what I want to do in this 0.0.x versions. I will change everything when it'll be necessary.

These versions has for goal to create many things that will be necessary just for me.

## 0.x
At this state of the project, it WILL be usable as a serious alternative to other libraries.

## 1.x
Every features will be good to go, every thing will be implemented and the only things left to do will be cleaning the code and resolving the bugs.
